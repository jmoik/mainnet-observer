<!--more-->

This chart displays the cumulative total of all inputs spent for each Bitcoin script type since the beginning of the blockchain. Each line represents a different input type, showing how the cumulative number of inputs for that type grows over time. For P2TR, keypath and scriptpath spends are tracked separately.
